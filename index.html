        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A turkey carcass soup is the answer when you don't want to waste a single bite of turkey. This is a delicious soup and one of my favorites. If you want to freeze some, leave out the potatoes.</p>
        <h3>What is a turkey carcass?</h3>
        <p>A turkey carcass is what's left after you finish a whole turkey. Instead of throwing the carcass away, some people like to use every bit of the bird by making stock or soup.</p>
        <p>The bones and remaining scraps of meat add rich flavor to the broth, ensuring you get every bit of deliciousness out of your holiday dinner.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 turkey carcass</li>
            <li>4 quarts water</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Place turkey carcass into a large soup pot; pour in water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the remaining meat falls off the bones, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove turkey carcass from the pot. Remove and chop any remaining turkey meat. Discard carcass.</li>
        </ol>
